[Frontend Dockerfile](https://github.com/hartzka/devops-hy-20/blob/master/part1/1.10/Dockerfile)

[Backend Dockerfile](https://github.com/hartzka/devops-hy-20/blob/master/part1/1.11/Dockerfile)

I changed the backend and frontend ports to 5001 and 5002.
Additionally, I added API_URL to frontend environment.

Now, all but the last button are working at http://localhost:5002 and all buttons are working at http://localhost.
